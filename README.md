# üìò JavaScript Upskilling Projects

Welcome to my **JavaScript Upskilling** repository!

This is a personal collection of focused frontend projects created using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. Each project is part of my self-driven journey to strengthen and refine core web development skills through hands-on practice.

The projects cover a wide range of real-world scenarios and gradually progress from foundational JavaScript concepts to more advanced topics like:

- DOM manipulation
- Event handling
- UI interactivity
- Live counters and animations
- Mini-games and logic-based components
