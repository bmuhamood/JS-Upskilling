<!-- Build a Favorite Icon Toggler
Build an app that is functionally similar to this example project. Try not to copy the example project, give it your own personal style.

In this lab you will use JavaScript click events to toggle the appearance of a favorite icon. When the heart icon is clicked, the appearance of the heart changes from empty to filled, and vice versa.

Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.

User Stories:

You should have an unordered list with three items.
The unordered list should have the class item-list.
The three list items should contain the item name followed by a button element with the class favorite-icon.
The button element should contain the code &#9825; initially to represent an empty heart.
When a button element containing a heart is clicked, you should add a class named filled to the clicked button if it's not already present, and remove it, if it is.
You should have a class selector that targets the filled class and sets some CSS properties.
When a button element containing a heart is clicked, the heart symbol should toggle between &#9825; (empty heart) and &#10084; (filled heart), depending on its current state.
Note: Be sure to link your JavaScript file in your HTML. (Ex. <script src="script.js"></script>)
